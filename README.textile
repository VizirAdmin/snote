h2. Why does Snote exist?

Because I was in trouble for to maintain my notes. Some were in Google Docs, another in simples files in my computer, another in my notebook. In summary, a mess!

Therefore, I decided to create a tool where I could write my notes in a simple and fast way. And more, I' m planning, to do the search in a very nice way to find my notes.

Snote is a tool to help you to store your knowledge, after all, is a sucks, don't remember something you know.
